msgstr ""

#: ../../Lib/site-packages/pip/_vendor/README.rst:26
msgid ""
"Historically pip has not had any dependencies except for ``setuptools`` "
"itself, choosing instead to implement any functionality it needed to "
"prevent needing a dependency. However, starting with pip 1.5, we began to"
" replace code that was implemented inside of pip with reusable libraries "
"from PyPI. This brought the typical benefits of reusing libraries instead"
" of reinventing the wheel like higher quality and more battle tested "
"code, centralization of bug fixes (particularly security sensitive ones),"
" and better/more features for less work."

"When pip depends on another library to function then if for whatever "
"reason that library either isn't installed or an incompatible version is "
"installed then pip ceases to function. This is of course true for all "
"Python applications, however for every application *except* for pip the "
"way you fix it is by re-running pip. Obviously, when pip can't run, you "
"can't use pip to fix pip, so you're left having to manually resolve "
"dependencies and installing them by hand."

"One of pip's current dependencies is the ``requests`` library, for which "
"pip requires a fairly recent version to run.  If pip depended on "
"``requests`` in the traditional manner, then we'd either have to maintain"
" compatibility with every ``requests`` version that has ever existed (and"
" ever will), OR allow pip to render certain versions of ``requests`` "
"uninstallable. (The second issue, although technically true for any "
"Python application, is magnified by pip's ubiquity; pip is installed by "
"default in Python, in ``pyvenv``, and in ``virtualenv``.)"

msgid "**Security**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Lib/site-packages/pip/_vendor/README.rst:57
msgid ""
"This might seem puzzling at first glance, since vendoring has a tendency "
"to complicate updating dependencies for security updates, and that holds "
"true for pip. However, given the *other* reasons for avoiding "
"dependencies, the alternative is for pip to reinvent the wheel itself.  "
"This is what pip did historically. It forced pip to re-implement its own "
"HTTPS verification routines as a workaround for the Python standard "
"library's lack of SSL validation, which resulted in similar bugs in the "
"validation routine in ``requests`` and ``urllib3``, except that they had "
"to be discovered and fixed independently. Even though we're vendoring, "
"reusing libraries keeps pip more secure by relying on the great work of "
"our dependencies, *and* allowing for faster, easier security fixes by "
"simply pulling in newer versions of dependencies."

"Currently most popular methods of installing pip rely on pip's self-"
"contained nature to install pip itself. These tools work by bundling a "
"copy of pip, adding it to ``sys.path``, and then executing that copy of "
"pip. This is done instead of implementing a \"mini installer\" (to reduce"
" duplication); pip already knows how to install a Python package, and is "
"far more battle-tested than any \"mini installer\" could ever possibly "
"be."

"Many downstream redistributors have policies against this kind of "
"bundling, and instead opt to patch the software they distribute to "
"debundle it and make it rely on the global versions of the software that "
"they already have packaged (which may have its own patches applied to "
"it). We (the pip team) would prefer it if pip was *not* debundled in this"
" manner due to the above reasons and instead we would prefer it if pip "
"would be left intact as it is now."

"In the longer term, if someone has a *portable* solution to the above "

"add additional problems that are unreasonable then we would be happy to "
"consider, and possibly switch to said method. This solution must function"
" correctly across all of the situation that we expect pip to be used and "
"not mandate some external mechanism such as OS packages."
